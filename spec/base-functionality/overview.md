- **Player Identity:** No session-based player persistence

### üü° **Needs Implementation (30%)**

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority:** Fix player-vote association and route response architecture
2. **Phase 2 Priority:** Implement game discovery and basic player identity
3. **Phase 3 Priority:** Add vote calculations and complete game logic
4. **Phase 4 Priority:** Security hardening and production readiness
5. **Documentation:** Update this spec after each major milestone

This updated audit reflects the real architectural state: solid infrastructure with critical functionality gaps that need fixing before the app can work correctly. The foundation is excellent, but core user flows are currently broken.
