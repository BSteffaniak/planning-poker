# Planning Poker Specification System

This directory contains the specification and tracking system for completing the Planning Poker application. The system is inspired by MoosicBox's DST (Deterministic Simulation Testing) approach, adapted for project completion tracking.

## Directory Structure

```
spec/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ completion/           # Project completion tracking
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PREAMBLE.md      # Working guide for spec maintenance
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ overview.md      # Main audit and tracking document
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ patterns.md      # Reusable solution patterns
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # This file
```

## Purpose

The specification system serves multiple purposes:

1. **Progress Tracking** - Systematic audit of what's complete vs. what's needed
2. **Work Planning** - Clear roadmap with phases and dependencies
3. **Quality Assurance** - Documentation requirements for completed work
4. **Knowledge Base** - Patterns and solutions for consistent implementation
5. **Communication** - Clear status for stakeholders and contributors

## How to Use This System

### For Development Work

1. **Start with the Overview** - Check `completion/overview.md` for current status
2. **Follow the Preamble** - Read `completion/PREAMBLE.md` for working guidelines
3. **Use Patterns** - Reference `completion/patterns.md` for consistent solutions
4. **Update Progress** - Document completed work with evidence and validation

### For Project Planning

1. **Review Current Status** - Check completion percentages in overview.md
2. **Identify Blockers** - Look for ‚ùå items that need attention
3. **Plan Next Steps** - Focus on unblocked üü° items
4. **Track Dependencies** - Understand what blocks other work

### For Quality Assurance

1. **Verify Documentation** - Ensure completed items have proper evidence
2. **Check Patterns** - Validate implementations follow established patterns
3. **Review Testing** - Confirm validation methods are appropriate
4. **Audit Progress** - Ensure status markers accurately reflect reality

## Status Markers

The system uses consistent status markers throughout:

- üî¥ **Critical** - Blocks production deployment
- üü° **Important** - Affects user experience or reliability  
- üü¢ **Minor** - Nice-to-have or polish items
- ‚úÖ **Complete** - Fully implemented and validated
- üü° **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- ‚ùå **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies or design decisions

## Documentation Standards

### Completed Work Must Include

1. **File References** - Exact locations with line numbers
2. **Implementation Details** - What was actually done
3. **Validation Evidence** - How it was tested/verified
4. **Pattern Usage** - Which patterns were applied

### Example Documentation

```markdown
- [x] `packages/poker/src/lib.rs:45-89` - Vote calculation logic ‚úÖ COMPLETED
    - Lines 45-67: Implemented median calculation for story points
    - Lines 68-78: Added outlier detection for consensus checking  
    - Lines 79-89: Vote validation and sanitization
    - Validation: Unit tests pass, tested with simulator scenarios
    - Pattern: Pure functions for business logic calculations
```

## Key Documents

### completion/overview.md
The main tracking document containing:
- Executive summary with completion percentage
- Detailed audit of all application areas
- Status of each feature and component
- Execution plan with phases and priorities
- Success metrics and next steps

### completion/PREAMBLE.md
Working guide that defines:
- How to approach spec discussions
- Documentation standards and requirements
- Checkbox protocol for tracking completion
- Working patterns for different types of tasks
- Quality checklist for completed work

### completion/patterns.md
Reusable solution patterns including:
- WebSocket communication patterns
- State management approaches
- Error handling strategies
- Testing methodologies
- Configuration management

## Workflow Integration

### Daily Development
1. Check overview.md for current priorities
2. Work on highest-priority unblocked items
3. Follow patterns.md for consistent implementation
4. Update progress with proper documentation

### Weekly Reviews
1. Update completion percentages
2. Identify new blockers or dependencies
3. Adjust priorities based on progress
4. Review and update patterns as needed

### Milestone Planning
1. Use execution plan phases for scheduling
2. Track critical path items for release planning
3. Ensure all dependencies are identified
4. Plan parallel work opportunities

## Benefits

This specification system provides:

- **Visibility** - Clear view of project status and progress
- **Consistency** - Standardized approaches across the codebase
- **Quality** - Documentation requirements ensure thorough work
- **Efficiency** - Patterns enable faster, more reliable development
- **Maintainability** - Comprehensive documentation aids future work

## Getting Started

1. Read `completion/PREAMBLE.md` to understand the working approach
2. Review `completion/overview.md` to see current project status
3. Check `completion/patterns.md` for implementation guidance
4. Start working on the highest-priority items
5. Document your progress following the established standards

The specification system is designed to be a living document that evolves with the project. Regular updates and maintenance ensure it remains an accurate and valuable resource for completing the Planning Poker application.
